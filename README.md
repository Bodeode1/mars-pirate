2. Read the game instructions and rules:
   - To start the game, press 'y' to start and 'n' to stop.
   - You can play the game 5 times, and you need to kill 3 aliens to win.
   - You kill an alien when you fire your weapon at their hiding cell.
   - The cells are numbered from 1 to 9 (10 not inclusive).
3. Once you are familiar with the instructions, return to the main menu.
4. Select option 1 to play the Pirate of Mars game.
5. Follow the prompts and make guesses to find and eliminate the alien pirates.
6. After each guess, the game will provide feedback on whether your guess was correct or not.
7. The game will keep track of your game statistics, including the time taken for each guess.
8. The game will end after the maximum number of trials is reached or when you win or lose.
9. At the end of the game, the game history and your score will be displayed.
10. To play again, you can return to the main menu and select option 1.

### Existing Features
- The Welcome Message

    - When a new game starts the welcome message is displayed.
    - The user is met with colour coded sections and ASCII art (Battleships Logo) for clarity. 
    - Within this the different types of ship are listed, as well as the: board size, total number of hits needed to win (17) and the different styles of marker.
    - It also contains the instructions in how to play the game.
    - The player is then prompted for name input, which complies to the validation checks listed. Input is repeated until a valid name is entered.

![Instructions](/assets/readme_files/battleship-instrutions.png)
![Name input](/assets/readme_files/battleship-name.png)
![Start game](/assets/readme_files/battleship-start-game.png)

- The Board
    - Once name input is validated, it is then used to create the player's board, which is displayed to them in the terminal. The user is prompted to place each ship in turn from smallest to largest (2-5), the ship size is displayed to them.
    - Orientation, row and then column inputs are requested for the ship location, all having validation checks on them. Before placement of the ships on the board, overlap and fit checks are ran on the input location for the ship, which must be passed else the user is prompted for input again.
    - Once a all of the inputs are entered and valid the ship is placed on the players board, their board is then printed to them with the placed ship for reference when placing the next. The computers ships are randomly placed on their board before the player places their ships, following the same validation checks.

![Player board](/assets/readme_files/player-board.png)

![Player placed all ships](/assets/readme_files/all-ships-placed.png)

- The Guess Board
    - Once the ships have been placed on each board the game play begins.
    - The player always goes first, their guess board is printed out to them for reference when entering a row and column, which must pass validation checks if not the user is prompted to enter valid data again. Once a valid input is entered the result of their attack is printed out to them before the guess board is updated and printed out to them again. The computers guess is printed out to the user alongside the computers board of where the player hit for reference to see where there shot landed. Validation checks prevent the user repeating already guessed spots on the board.
    - The sleep method of the time library and phase/line break is used to separate and emphasize the individual turns. There is a countdown of two seconds before the computer makes their attack and the terminal is updated this also adds more suspense.

![Guess ship](/assets/readme_files/guess-ship.png)
![Guess again](/assets/readme_files/guess-again.png)

- Ship Display
    - Ships that haven't been hit are displayed on the player's board as the at sign "@".
    - Letters are used for the column display and numbers for the rows, this allows for easy differentiation when inputting coordinates.
    - The markers that have been used give a good level of contrast and distinction between the different markers and what they represent.  "@" to represent ships, "-" for a miss and "X" for a hit.

![Ship display](/assets/readme_files/ship-display.png)

- Game Play Display
    - Feedback to the user is provided constantly throughout all phases of the game.
    - All sequences are broken down to increase ease of use and clarity. The boards are updated appropriately as well as the hit counter incrementing when required.
    - A consistent use of the sleep method and phase/line breaks is also used throughout to increase ease of use and clarity.

![Game play display](/assets/readme_files/play-game-display.png)

- Reset
    - Once all the conditions of an end game have been met, which is a player either computer or user has hit the total hit count of 17, the turn sequence is broken out off, with a win or lose message being displayed.
    - The Game will then show a thanks for playing message and after 10 seconds reset and go back to the welcome page where the user can choose to play again or exit.

### Features to Implement in the future
*There are no features left to implement from the initial scope of my project, however I have some features that I would like to add in the future.*

- Print the Player Board and Computer Board side by side in the terminal, rather than on top of one another.
- Make a 2 player version of the game.
- Let the player choose the size of the board.

## Issues and Bugs 
The developer ran into several issues during the development of the website, with the noteworthy ones listed below, along with solutions or ideas to implement in the future.

- Solved Bugs
    - A bug I came across was the players error message for when placing a ship which overlaps over existing ships or doesnâ€™t fit the board was being printed when it was the computers turn to place its ships. I fixed it by using a for loop in the players turn of the place ship function to print the message therefore no message would be printed if the computers ship overlapped or did not fit the board. 

    - A bug was found when replaying the game the board was not clearing the ships from the previous game. I fixed this by adding a reset funtion this clears the board so the game can be played again without exiting and restarting the app.

- Remaining Bugs
    - No bugs remaining.

## Testing

Due to the nature of the project, testing has been implemented throughout the entire project mainly debugging through running the program in the terminal as well as debugging using the python debugger. This is shown by commits of refactoring code.
Sections of code where developed before implementation to make sure it worked and also where run through the PEP8 validator.
Tested with invalid inputs: Such as using Type Errors and Value Errors, string instead of integers, out of bound inputs, same input twice.
Tested in both Gitpod terminal and CI Heroku terminal.
Limit testing has been conducted by myself, users and peers on slack through the peer-code-review channel, there is currently no reported issues that cause the game to break.

#### New User Goals:
1. As a new user, I want to see clear instructions for gameplay.
  - when the program is run, an introduction appears, telling the user how to play the game.
  
2. As a new user, I want to see a visual representation of my remaining lives.
  - On entering a wrong letter or word, a section of Funny Bones the skeleton is created. When the user has run out of tries, the skeleton will be fully formed.

3. As a new user, I want the ability to replay the game.
  - At the end of each game, regardless of the outcome, the user is given the option to enter Y to replay or N to end the game.

#### Current User
1. As a current user, I want the ability to replay the game.
  - At the end of each game, regardless of the outcome, the user is given the option to enter Y to replay or N to end the game.

2. As a current user, I want the guess word to follow a certain theme.
  - The entire game is Halloween themed, with a list of words that follow this theme. From "cemetery" to "ghouls" and plenty more besides.

3. As a current user, I want the choice to use different themes.
  - Unfortunately, this feature was not able to be implemented at this stage. 
  - In future developments, the user will have the option to input a number from a list, referencing the theme they wish to play with. This will include separate pages for each theme's code and separate lists of words to import.
